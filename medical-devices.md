# Bringing Medical Devices to Market

## Registration

https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/events/bringing-medical-devices-to-market-webinar-series/

## Purpose

1.	To gain an understanding of the process of bringing medical devices to market.
2.	To consider the potential impacts of your own research and those of others.
3.	To take an opportunity to begin thinking ahead about your future careers.
 
## Background
 
Computer algorithms and software designed for medical use are classified as medical devices and subject to regulatory approval before they can be placed on the market. This process is challenging and requires substantial effort but provides protection and safeguarding for users and the public. This course produced by Hardian Health will provide a series of training videos and virtual workshops to provide you with an overview of the process of bringing medical devices to market. This knowledge is not only of use to aspiring entrepreneurs but also to anyone who will be working in any environment in which medical products are produced and should be considered part of the working knowledge of practicing data scientists.

## Group Project
 
You will work in self-selected groups of 3-4 to consider the implications of each of the four core topics in the context of your own research.

### Intellectual Property 

What are the potential outputs or impacts of your research? Could these require protection and what could this involve? How will you decide if protection is required? You should identify and consider all the stakeholders involved in your research. 

### Medical device regulations and quality management 

What medical devices could arise from your research? How are medical devices are expected to be designed and managed? Contrast this to typical academic software development. Can you explain why some of the regulations exist and what they are designed to protect against?

### Health economics for software devices 

How might your research be used at-scale? Who will be the users? What would be the cost of deploying medical devices arising from your research? From whom would you be reimbursed?

### Clinical evidence for software devices 

What type of evidence would be required to support medical devices that might arise from your research? Who might need to be involved in providing that evidence? What would you measure to demonstrate effectiveness?

## Things to consider

As a group, you can decide to focus on the research of just one member of the group, or examine the shared interests of the groups or to look at differences between h.

Your research may not directly involve findings that could lead directly to creating medical devices but for this exercise you should consider the potential follow-on applications. Consider the following examples:

*Example 1: Epidemiological analysis*

Your PhD research is concerned with examining a large population of individuals and using or developing suitable analysis technique to identify sociodemographic factors that are associated with a health condition. The output of your PhD will be academic publications that describe the methodology and results of your analysis. However, the results of your analysis could be embedded within a self-help patient health software application or a predictive algorithm within a hospital dashboard. These will likely be classified as medical devices.

*Example 2: Biological analysis*

For your PhD research you are creating models that can predict mRNA structures from sequences. The output of your PhD will be academic publications that describe the methodology and analysis of structural predictions. You will be releasing open-source software which you expect to be used for molecule design by biotechnology companies for personalised mRNA-based therapies. Software essential to personalised therapeutics could be considered as in-vitro diagnostic devices.
