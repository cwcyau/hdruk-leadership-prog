# Bringing Medical Devices to Market

## Registration

Students should register for the upcoming workshops.

URL: https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/events/bringing-medical-devices-to-market-webinar-series/

## Purpose

1.	To gain an understanding of the process of bringing medical devices to market.
2.	To consider the potential impacts of your own research and those of others.
3.	To take an opportunity to begin thinking ahead about your future careers.
 
## Background
 
Computer algorithms and software designed for medical use are classified as medical devices and subject to regulatory approval before they can be placed on the market. This process is challenging and requires substantial effort but provides protection and safeguarding for users and the public. This course produced by Hardian Health will provide a series of training videos and virtual workshops to provide you with an overview of the process of bringing medical devices to market. This knowledge is not only of use to aspiring entrepreneurs but also to anyone who will be working in any environment in which medical products are produced and should be considered part of the working knowledge of practicing data scientists.

## Group Project
 
You will work in self-selected groups of 3-4 to consider the implications of each of the four core topics in the context of your own research. Please could nominated group leads send us a list of group members by e-mail to [phd@hdruk.ac.uk] by **28 February 2023**.

### Intellectual Property 

What are the potential outputs or impacts of your research? Could these require protection and what could this involve? How will you decide if protection is required? You should identify and consider all the stakeholders involved in your research. 

### Medical device regulations and quality management 

What medical devices could arise from your research? How are medical devices are expected to be designed and managed? Contrast this to typical academic software development. Can you explain why some of the regulations exist and what they are designed to protect against?

### Health economics for software devices 

How might your research be used at-scale? Who will be the users? What would be the cost of deploying medical devices arising from your research? From whom would you be reimbursed?

### Clinical evidence for software devices 

What type of evidence would be required to support medical devices that might arise from your research? Who might need to be involved in providing that evidence? What would you measure to demonstrate effectiveness?

## Report

### Overview

You will produce a short-written report (no more than 4 pages) which describes your discussions. 

Reports should contain:

1.	A description of the research you are undertaking,
2.	The possible translational applications and the types of medical devices that might arise from your research,
3.	The intellectual property considerations,
4.	The end-user groups and the economic considerations for possible solutions,
5.	The evidence that maybe required to push forward these technologies.

We will organise an in-person event during the summer (dates: tbc) for all groups to present their findings. This will be embedded within a wider PhD programme event.

Reports are due **15 June 2023** and should be submitted to [phd@hdruk.ac.uk].

### Further guidance

The purpose of this exercise is to describe how a piece of research that you are conducting could be the deployed as a medical device or to catalyst the production of medical devices. We will focus on "Software as a Medical Device" for this exercise. 

Reports should be approximately four A4 pages in length. The given word counts are for guidance. Only a single report is required per group but individual responses should be given to question six (as an Appendix).

You should structure your reports around the following five questions:

1. Concisely describe the scientific background of the research that might lead to the production of the medical device. [200 words]

2. Describe what medical device could arise as a direct or indirect result of this research. What problem does it solve? Describe how it might be used in practice? [400 words]

3. Sketch an outline of an "intended use" statement for this medical device. [150 words]

4. What evidence would need to be provided to demonstrate that the medical device conveys clinical benefit? Outline how this evidence would need to be collected. [250 words]

5. What are the safety considerations that need to be considered before the deployment and use of the medical device? What might need to happen after its deployment? [250 words]

6. Describe something you learnt about the development and deploying medical devices. What aspect of the process is more challenging than you envisaged? What are the prospects for deployment of medical devices arising from research in your area? [up to 250 words] Each member of the group should provide a response to this individally and add to the report as an Appendix.

### Mentoring support

We have arranged for each group to have a 30-minute mentoring session with Peter Bannister about your projects.

It is recommended that to make effective use of that time you do the following:

1. Provide a draft of any writing you have done,
2. Prepare a short 5-minute overview slide (or two) about your project objectives,
3. Come prepared with no more than 3-4 specific questions to be asked.

It is helpful to send Peter any prepared writing and questions a few days in advance of your meeting.

### Things to consider

As a group, you can decide to focus on the research of just one member of the group, or examine the shared interests of the groups or to look at differences between h.

Your research may not directly involve findings that could lead directly to creating medical devices but for this exercise you should consider the potential follow-on applications. Consider the following examples:

*Example 1: Epidemiological analysis*

Your PhD research is concerned with examining a large population of individuals and using or developing suitable analysis technique to identify sociodemographic factors that are associated with a health condition. The output of your PhD will be academic publications that describe the methodology and results of your analysis. However, the results of your analysis could be embedded within a self-help patient health software application or a predictive algorithm within a hospital dashboard. These will likely be classified as medical devices.

*Example 2: Biological analysis*

For your PhD research you are creating models that can predict mRNA structures from sequences. The output of your PhD will be academic publications that describe the methodology and analysis of structural predictions. You will be releasing open-source software which you expect to be used for molecule design by biotechnology companies for personalised mRNA-based therapies. Software essential to personalised therapeutics could be considered as in-vitro diagnostic devices.
