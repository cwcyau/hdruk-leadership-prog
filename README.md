# Health Data Research UK Leadership Programme

The HDRUK Leadership Programme consists of a series of components designed to provide students with an introduction to a variety of leadership skills and capabilities.

In Year Two, students will undertake a [Needs & Evidence](evidence.md) course which will examine the role of identifying needs, acquiring evidence, and working with stakeholders. 

In Year Three, students will begin to consider the wider context of their research and its potential translational application through a course on [Bringing medical devices to market](medical-devices.md).

In Year Four, students will undertake an individually-designed project based on their interests and needs to practice and reflect on their leadership capabilities.
