# Health Data Research UK Leadership Programme

The HDRUK Leadership Programme consists of a series of components designed to provide students with an introduction to a variety of leadership skills and capabilities.

In **Year Two**, students will undertake a [Needs & Evidence](evidence.md) course which will examine the role of identifying needs, acquiring evidence, and working with stakeholders. The course is intended to demonstrate the need for leaders to have effective communication skills and to be able to develop mutually beneficial stakeholder partnerships. Mentoring will be provided for projects arising.

In **Year Three**, students will begin to consider the wider context of their research and its potential translational applications through a course on [Bringing medical devices to market](medical-devices.md). This course is intended to encourage students to consider the future vision of their research, consider more broadly the scientific and technological landscape in which they operate and who might benefit from or exploit the research that they are undertaking. The students will also receive introductory training in the regulatory and legal requirements of technology development.

In **Year Four**, students will undertake an individually-designed personal development project based on their interests and needs to practice and reflect on their leadership capabilities. The projects represent an opportunity to prepare for the next stage of their careers.
