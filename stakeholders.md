# Understanding stakeholders and effective communication

In Year 2 you will begin to develop your leadership capabilities in a variety of ways. This project will underpin those efforts and give you a chance to practically apply those skills.
 
## The Project
 
You will work in teams of 4 but, within each team, each individual must have a designated role and responsibility for a series of tasks. 

As a group you will consider your collective interests and develop a plan for an organised activity. You are free to think creatively but possible examples include: 
 
- Organising an event such as a workshop between different communities,
- Writing and publicising a guidance on an area of interest,
- Planning and delivering a taught course.
 
The only restriction is that the project should not be a standard academic activity (e.g. seminars, conferences, research papers). Possible themes (and possible initial contacts) include:

- Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
- Public-Patient Participation, Involvement and Engagement
- Academic-Industry Engagement
- Data science for under-18s and undergraduates
- Learning from other disciplines and data skills
- Supporting non-government organisations

You will need to set your own targets, goals and delivery timetable (aligned with the project milestones - below).

## Your Role

We want you to consider taking on opportunities that challenge you personally. If you do not feel confident with your communications, try a communications-focused role. If you have difficulties with using lay language, take on a role that involves engaging with the public. 

Your role is also to support each other in this project and across teams and to maintain a positive partnership. 

## Who can help you?

A key aspect of this project is finding the people and resources you need to support you in designing and delivering this project yourselves. This could be through your own universities but also through HDRUK you have access to a substantial network. Your status as HDRUK PhD students will open doors or give you access to those who can. The Leadership Programme team will provide general mentorship and advice throughout.

## What does success look like?

Our expectation is that you will make a genuine and concerted effort to succeed with your intended project and to deliver on your self-designed goals. 

Checkpoints during the course of the project will allow you to determine feasibility and whether final deliverables can be actioned. Progression through these checkpoints is not required - if a project has to stop, it has to stop, what is important is what can you learn from the project, and how might you do better next time.

The Year 2 Project is part of a three-year leadership programme and, from the perspective of the PhD programme, we see success in terms of your own personal growth and that of the cohort. Throughout the project, you will get together as a cohort to reflect on your personal and collective experiences. 
 
## Project Aims
 
- To identify a novel personal challenge that inspires and motivates you.
- To gain experience of personally leading a (sub)project from concept to implementation,
- To work with others in the delivery of your project,
- To reflect on your own project experiences and shape a personal development plan,
- To support other students in the delivery of their projects and openly share insights and experiences with the group.
- To embed some of the leadership styles and approaches you will be learning about in the Year 2 Leadership Programme.

## Initial Project Proposal

Your initial project proposal should address the following five questions:

- What problem does your solution address? Describe what your final idea looks like? [200 words]
- What support do you need to implement your idea? [100 words]
- What resources do you need? [100 words]
- What team and responsibility roles will be involved? [100 words]
- What is the first step? [50 words]

## Detailed Project Proposal

*In the next stage, we would like you to focus on refining your project ideas.*

You will adopt the following structure: 

a. Needs and evidence

our proposals have outlined some needs. In this next stage, we would like you to consider the evidence for those needs. 
Why is this an issue? If these needs are meant, what would happen?
Who else has identified these needs? Who else supports your claims? If no-one else, what type of evidence would you need to collect to justify your claims?
This stage is *critical* for establishing the importance and requirement for a solution. You may wish to do some literature review and also have conversations with relevant stakeholders.

b. Aims
Once a need has been established. You will need to identify specific aims. Aims often start with To... and describe the changes you are trying to achieve, e.g. To provide medical students with some knowledge and skill of how to do data science.

c. Objectives

Given your aims, the objectives of the project will detail how you are going to meet those aims. These are the actual activities that you will run, e.g. to run a workshop.

d. Outputs

Your project outputs are what you expect to 'produce' - if you were making a machine, what would come out. These are tightly connected with the objectives but focus on the products of the activities rather than the activities themselves, e.g. if we host a workshop, what comes out at the end of it, a report?

e. Outcomes

Project outcomes are the changes you will have caused due to the project. Outcomes will be written as if the project has been completed and include words such as more, greater etc

*Participants have a greater knowledge of data science techniques*

*Stakeholders agree on a common framework for improving medical student data science education*

These are the long-term (or legacy) effects of the work that you will do.

f. Outcome indicators

Strong outcomes are measurable. How will you know if you have achieved your outcomes, and to what extent? These need to be quantifiable:

*70% of participants have a greater knowledge of health data science techniques,*

*12 partners agreed that a common framework for medical student data science education is necessary.*

## Task

For December 15, we want you to specifically focus on the Needs and Evidence stage (“the problem”) as well as the Outcome stage (“the vision”). The other sections can be left relatively brief or at a sketch stage.

We want to establish “why” you would want to do these projects and the changes you want to promote that are required to address the needs. 

We would like you to think broadly about the stakeholders involved and adopt a technique called “influence mapping” to identify the key relationships. A guide to this technique is given here.

We encourage you to think carefully about the difference between outputs and outcomes. Watch this video.

You are encouraged to work in an iterative and non-linear way to address (a-f) in the above. For example, you may need to give a hint of your current intended outputs and outcomes in order to elicit a conversation with a stakeholder to discuss the needs and the evidence for those.

We would like a (maximum) four page report for each project for the next submission.
